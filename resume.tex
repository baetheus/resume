\sub{Summary}
I am an experienced full stack software engineer primarily working with \textbf{Angular}, \textbf{React}, and \textbf{Node.js}. I am operating system and build chain agnostic, but I have a soft spot for SmartOS and OS X. My background in theoretical mathematics lends itself handily to general problem solving, rigorous analysis, and implementation nuances. I'm a strong proponent of the idea that systems and systems software can and should be provably correct.
