\sub{Work Experience}

\split{Shoutpoint}{Software Engineer}{May 2017 -- Present}
Frontend and middleware software engineer. I work primarily with \textbf{AngularJS}, \textbf{Angular}, \textbf{Typescript}, \textbf{Ngrx}, \textbf{Nodejs}, \textbf{Express}, \textbf{rxjs}, and a large collection of open source libraries. I also collaborated with the IT team towards implementing \textbf{containerization} and starting a migration to \textbf{Kubernetes}. I established Angular standard practices including \textbf{reactive forms design}, \textbf{component encapsulation}, \textbf{templatization}, and \textbf{project architecture}.

\split{Keyboard Cowboys}{Consultant / Software Engineer}{Oct 2006 - Present}
I operate a local consulting firm for small and medium sized businesses. Services provided cover \textbf{software engineering}, \textbf{systems administration}, \textbf{custom application development}, \textbf{break fix}, and \textbf{web development}.

\split{Shoutpoint}{Systems Administrator}{Sept 2013 -- Dec 2015}
Designed and maintained critical infrastructure components such as physical networks and servers. Developed internal IT tooling in \textbf{Bash} and \textbf{Node.js} to automate a custom \textbf{Xen} virtual machine build system. Used \textbf{Ansible}, \textbf{Ansible Playbooks}, and \textbf{Custom Ansible Modules} to coordinate physical resources, networking resources, vm creation, and bootstrapping internal applications. Developed tooling that managed and updated internal \textbf{yum} and \textbf{apt} repositories and deployment of Puppet manifests. Designed \textbf{Puppet} modules to handle dynamically building internal \textbf{DNS} and \textbf{NTP} servers.

\split{GoDaddy.com}{Data Center Engineer}{Aug 2007 -- Aug 2010}
Was responsible for the build out and maintenance of \textbf{enterprise level data centers} across a private MAN in the Phoenix metropolitan area. \textbf{Trained} junior technicians to use proprietary software, manage hardware, and understand company workflow. \textbf{Headed critical deployments} for front of site and infrastructure upgrades for the data center team. Acted as the \textbf{final tier of customer support} for dedicated and virtual machine customers. Compiled and edited all internal documentation created by the datacenter team. Created and maintained the data center team \textbf{knowledge base}.

\split{Magenta Computer}{Technician}{Aug 2001 -- Aug 2004}
Was responsible for \textbf{parts inventory}, custom desktop and \textbf{server manufacturing}, hardware and software \textbf{troubleshooting}, and \textbf{data recovery}. Cut my teeth here on everything from Intel's 486DX2 to the first Xeons and beyond.

\sub{Summary}
I am an experienced full stack software engineer currently working in Angular and Ngrx heaven. Additionally, I have direct experience with the design and implementation of build system workflow, re-engineering encumbered systems, and performance analysis. I am operating system and build chain agnostic, but I have a soft spot for SmartOS and OS X. My background in theoretical mathematics lends itself handily to general problem solving, rigorous analysis, and implementation nuances. I'm a strong proponent of the idea that systems and systems software can and should be provably correct.
