\sub{Work Experience}

\split{Keyboard Cowboys}{IT Consultant}{Oct 2006 - Present}
I operate a local consulting firm for small and medium sized businesses. During peak periods, the firm manages an average of 15 contracted customers each month with a combined average footprint of 32 servers, 180 workstations, and 7 business networks. Services provided cover \textbf{systems administration}, \textbf{custom application development}, \textbf{break fix}, and \textbf{web development}. In most cases, customers were able to reduce their IT budget to \$250 per month by switching to Keyboard Cowboys.

\split{Shoutpoint}{Systems Administrator}{Sept 2013 -- Dec 2015}
Designed and maintained critical infrastructure components from the physical networks and servers to application deployment workflow. Developed most of the internal IT tooling in \textbf{Bash} and \textbf{Node.js} to automate a custom \textbf{Xen} virtual machine build system. These internal tools required coordinating resources across 5 geographically diverse data centers and ultimately reduced build time from days to minutes. Developed and implemented tooling that managed and updated internal \textbf{yum} and \textbf{apt} repositories as well as handled the regular deployment of Puppet infrastructure and application code. Introduced the IT and applications departments to version control for infrastructure code. Designed \textbf{Puppet} modules to handle dynamically building internal \textbf{DNS} and \textbf{NTP} servers.

\split{GoDaddy.com}{Data Center Engineer}{Aug 2007 -- Aug 2010}
I was responsible for the build out and maintenance of \textbf{enterprise level data centers} across a private MAN in the Phoenix metropolitan area. \textbf{Trained} and assessed the skills of junior technicians in proprietary software, hardware proficiency, and company workflow. \textbf{Headed critical deployments} for front of site and infrastructure upgrades for the data center team. Acted as the \textbf{final tier of customer support} for dedicated and virtual machine customers. Compiled and edited all internal documentation created by the datacenter team. Created and maintained the data center team \textbf{knowledge base}.

\split{Magenta Computer}{Technician}{Aug 2001 -- Aug 2004}
Was responsible for \textbf{parts inventory}, custom desktop and \textbf{server manufacturing}, hardware and software \textbf{troubleshooting}, and \textbf{data recovery}. I cut my teeth here on everything from Intel's 486DX2 to the first Xeons and beyond. At the end of my tenure I had built over 4000 desktop and server computers and repaired about half that many.

\sub{Summary}
Unix administrator with a background in full stack tools development. Direct experience with the design and implementation of build system workflow, re-engineering encumbered systems, and performance analysis. Operating system and build chain agnostic, although I have a soft spot for SmartOS and OS X. My theoretical background in mathematics lends itself handily to general problem solving, rigorous analysis, and implementation nuances. I'm a strong proponent of the idea that systems and systems software can and should be provably correct.

\split{documentation}{\href{https://gist.github.com/baetheus}{gist.github.com/baetheus}}{Ongoing}
This is a repository of various public documentation that I have created over time. It includes primarily setup processes for open source software on SmartOS zones as well as some small bash scripts for SmartOS management.

\sub{Education}
\split{Bachelors of Science in Mathematics}{University of California, Irvine}{2014 - 2017}
I am currently a part time student in my last year of study at UCI. My focus is in pure math with particular attention paid to Abstract Algebra and Galois Theory.
